## Installation

Recommended installation with [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/latest/).


Make a python environment of your own and tell pdm to use it with `pdm use /path/to/your/venv` or let pdm handle the venv for you and simply:

```
pdm sync
```

This will install the application into the environment and you can call the scripts from the command line, e.g.:
```
conda activate <env>
python DaphniaDetectv2/src/daphniadetectv2/BoundingBoxOnly.py
```

Alternatively, install the project into your project.
For example, as an editable install from a local folder with pdm:
```
cd your-project
pdm add "daphniadetectv2 @ git+http://github.com/Fipsii/DaphniaDetectv2.git@main#egg=daphniadetectv2"
```
